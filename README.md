# pythoncronometer
Since Cronometer won't release API this python library allows to communicate with Cronometer without going through their site. Goal is to create alternative interface incorporating natural language processing and provide additional functionality with smart meal planning using decision aiding algorithms. 

If Cronometer team does not want this to be public feel free to contact me.
